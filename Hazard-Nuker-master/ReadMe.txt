Changes i did:-
1. i've removed update.py because the link in code was 404 github error page link so because of that hazard nuker was not able to start
2. i was faacing a issue about qr-grabber [choice 14] 
    the qr templates were missing as the link in code was again a 404 github error link so beacuse of this , the function was not able to execute
    so i.ve changed the link of qr grabber template
    
    
Rest of the program is same only i did this small fixes as i thought it would be great,
but if you don't want this email me at ab1236191@gmail.com i'll delete this with 48 hours 

thank you
